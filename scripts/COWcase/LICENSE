Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer 
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and 
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of 
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work so that 
that work will be in the public domain and thus free of copyright and related 
rights restrictions. For these owners, the primary use of this Deed is to 
serve as the operative, binding record of their intent to relinquish all 
Copyright and Related Rights they have in the Work that is the subject of the 
Notice and subsequent license back to any person who accesses, uses or copies 
any of the Work.

When a person accesses, uses or copies a Work subject to CC0, the person 
obtains the Work without any conditions or restrictions whatsoever on use, 
modification, reproduction, publication, distribution, transmission, public 
performance, display, or any other exploitation.

CC0 provides that an owner may provide the Work as-is and disclaims warranties 
and other liability relating to the Work.
