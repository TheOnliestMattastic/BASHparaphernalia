## 🔭 Overview

This repository contains `MTrclone.sh`, a Bash script to mount cloud drives (OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox) using rclone with automated verification and notifications.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Mounting**: Mounts OneDrive, GoogleDrive, and Dropbox in the background.
- **Mount Verification**: Checks mount status using `findmnt` after mounting.
- **Notifications**: Provides cow-themed notifications via `xcowsay` for success/failure states.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with cleanup on exit.
- **Non-Interactive**: Runs fully automated with proper logging.
- **Directory Creation**: Automatically creates mount directories if they don't exist.

## ⚛️ Requirements

- **rclone** installed and configured with remotes named `OneDrive`, `GoogleDrive`, and `Dropbox`.
- Local mount directories must be empty or non-existent (script creates them).
- Required system commands: `findmnt`, `xcowsay`.
- Nobara or Fedora Linux (or compatible system with required tools).

## 🚀 Mounting Up

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheOnliestMattastic/BASHparaphernalia.git
cd BASHparaphernalia/scripts/MTrclone
```

Make the script executable and run:

```sh
chmod +x MTrclone.sh
./MTrclone.sh
```

### Optional: Run at Login

Select this script via System Settings -> Autostart -> Add New (recommended), or create a `.desktop` file in `~/.config/autostart/`:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Exec=/path/to/MTrclone.sh
Icon=application-x-shellscript
Name=MTrclone.sh
Type=Application
X-KDE-AutostartScript=true
```

Ensure the script is executable:

```sh
chmod +x MTrclone.sh
```

## 🌠 TODO: Future Features

- [ ] **Configurable Mount Points**: Allow custom mount directories via command-line flags.
- [ ] **Selective Mounting**: Option to mount only specific drives.
- [ ] **Mount Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with remount on failure.
- [ ] **Logging Levels**: Verbose/debug logging options.
- [ ] **GUI Notifications**: Alternative notification methods (notify-send, etc.).

## 🌌 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues for bugs or feature requests, and submit pull requests for code changes.

## 🌕 Notes

- Designed for Nobara/Fedora with rclone; adapt for other distros if needed.
- Requires proper rclone configuration with exact remote names.
- Mount directories default to `/home/mattastic/{DriveName}`.
- Uses `rclone --vfs-cache-mode full` for optimal performance.
- Waits 60 seconds for mounts to establish before verification.
